# GPT-Data-Extender

## Overview

GPT-Data-Extender is a Python library designed to aid data scientists and analysts in enriching their datasets with the help of AI-generated content. This tool leverages state-of-the-art language models to automate a range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency.

## Use Case

In today's world, data comes in various shapes and forms. However, incomplete or sparse datasets can often limit the analytical capabilities of researchers and professionals alike. The primary use case for GPT-Data-Extender is to address these limitations by supplementing datasets with AI-generated content. For example:

- Imagine working with customer reviews but lacking information on sentiment or relevant topics. GPT-Data-Extender can automatically generate these additional columns.
  
- If you have a dataset of product names but need detailed descriptions, this tool can facilitate that as well.

## Main Features

### Column Extension

Easily generate new columns in your dataset based on custom AI prompts. For instance, if you have a column of company names, you can use GPT-Data-Extender to generate another column that contains brief descriptions or histories of these companies.

### Text Automation

Automate a variety of text manipulations such as summarization, translation, or text generation to enhance your data without manual intervention.

### NLP Tasks Automation

GPT-Data-Extender supports a host of NLP tasks like:

- Topic Detection
- Sentiment Classification
- Named Entity Recognition
- And much more!
